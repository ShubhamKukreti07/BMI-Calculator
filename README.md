# technojam-Android-task1
Hello i am Shubham Kukreti. I am from delhi. I am pursuing B.Tech CSE with specialization in AI&ML from galgotias university.
So telling you my few intrests except codindg are  singing /listening song and rapping, playing football, sketching and i play guitar too.
From school only coding attracts my intrest and  i have learnt python in 12 standard .
Now i think i can explore more through this platform technojam so i am ready to willingly put my efforts.


so this is my very first time i am working with java and xml. 
So i started this by checking the resoures provided with the task's link first.
Then i started with my project-

1. Set up project .

2. Link firebase and git to android project.

3. Start making Ui for project.

4. After finishing ui then I start with the code.


/******For LOgin and Sign up Screen***/
For login and signup I used firebase authentication for validate Email and password.

/**** For User Detail Screen******/
In this screen we get the input from user for calculate BMI. 

Formula for Bmi = weight/ height* height.

/****** Screen to  show bmi value and category***/
I get data from previous screen using INtent class and set in this screen.



At the start i faced problems in firebase authentication but it was settled after following the resoures carefully.


Then comes the xml files or the layout of the screens .
For that i checked for the syntax and related information on google like different views and all .
I created all of the screens layout using linear view.
Then i used textviews,edittext , button and spinner to display the desired screen .


As it was my first time i was not aware with the codes and syntax so my sister helped me in understanding the codes and suggested related information .
Then i started with te code 
for passing the data fron one screen to another screen using Intent.putextra(key, value) and get itno another screen using getIntent.getStringExtra(key)

Fror switch from one screen two another I user startActivity() method and pass Intent() with class name in it like startActivity(new Intent(CurrentScreenName.this,NextScreenName.class))
