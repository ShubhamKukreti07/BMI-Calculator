# technojam-Android-task1
Hello i am Shubham Kukreti. I am from delhi. I am pursuing B.Tech CSE with specialization in AI&ML from galgotias university.
So telling you my few intrests are i love to sing /listening song and rapping, playing football, sketching and i play guitar too.

so this is my very time i am working with java and xml. 
So i started this by checking the resoures provided with the task's link first.


1. Set up project .

2. Link firebase and git to android project.

3. Start making Ui for project.

4. After finishing ui then I start with the code.


/******For LOgin and Sign up Screen***/
For login and signup I used firebase authentication for validate Email and password.

/**** For User Detail Screen******/
In this screen we get the input from user for calculate BMI. 

Formula for Bmi = weight/ height* height.

/****** Screen to  show bmi value and category***/
I get data from previous screen using INtent class and set in this screen.



At the start i faced problems but it was settled after following the resoures carefully. 
Then comes the xml files or the layout of the screens .
For that i checked for the syntax and related information on google like different views and all . 
I created all of the screens layout using linear view.
Then i added textviews and spinner. They were bit easy to make and hadn't took much time . 
Few area where i faced problems were the spinner part and adding buttons.
After that which took most of the time was the data passing between the activities.
